# PPSploit
A small exploiting system with little to no design and UI, runs on a good API that updates quite alot. This is for new exploiters and a better version of JJsploit.

--How to use--
Join up your favourite roblox game and open up PPslpoit.
https://roblox.com/login (Login to an already created account here)
https://roblox.com/home (Start playing a game when logged in)
https://roblox.com (If you have never created an account)

Press the gear on the top to logout of your account at any time and to create a new one.

Anyways, back to the app.

Join any roblox game. Preferably one that you like, open up PPslpoit and press the ''Inject'' button.
If you see a small black windows screen for a couple seconds, that means that its working.
On the bottom right of your screen, you will see a WRD logo, meaning that it has sucessfully injected.

Now move on to the big white box, and paste a script to execute inside there.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source (An admin script, execute commands in roblox chat with the prefix '';'' Ex. ;fly )

Once you have pasted a script, press the other button. (Execute) And your script should load, if your game crashes, the script is much too complex for this executor 
and I recommend using something like KRNL. A higher level executor, but that needs a key. (You need to watch quite a few ads to get a key, you need a key to use KNRL every 24-ish)


(PPsploit does not require a key, and can run most scripts, I'd say like 98% of them are runnable.)

Once you have executed the script, and it does load, you should be able to tinker around to your hearts content and maybe get good? (Maybe even for the first time! :wow:)

Anyways, I thank you for using this awesome script, and hope you have fun with it!

(PPslpoit is not a trademark, but marking it as your own or whatever you scums want to do will hurt my feelings, please do not make PPsploit payed, as it is a free exploit that I hope can help out the roblox community!
